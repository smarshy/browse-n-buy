# browse-n-buy
Movie Library in C++

An old project written in Turbo C++

1. Functions as a store 
2. Maintains your records
3. Lets you browse and buy titles
4. Presents you with a bill in the end

P.S. I just went through this while uploading. Please forgive the hardcoding. This was written with a friend way back as a school board project, when we were just too happy that it worked!
